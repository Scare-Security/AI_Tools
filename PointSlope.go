To calculate a point-slope formula in Go, you can use the built-in math package to perform the necessary mathematical operations.

Here's an example of how you can calculate a point-slope formula in Go:

In this example, the x1, y1, and m variables represent the coordinates of the point and the slope of the line, respectively. The y variable is calculated using the point-slope form of the line, and then the result is printed to the screen.

You can use this same approach to calculate the point-slope form of a line for any given point and slope. Simply substitute the appropriate values for x1, y1, and m in the formula y - y1 = m(x - x1), and then use the math package to perform the calculations.
