* Writing aimbot 

```
It is generally not advisable to use an aimbot in online games such as Fortnite, as it is against the game's terms of service and can lead to your account being banned. Additionally, writing an aimbot for Fortnite or any other game is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of game mechanics, game memory, and reverse engineering.

However, if you still want to try writing an aimbot for Fortnite in C++20, you can use a combination of memory scanning and injection techniques to read the game's memory and modify it to automatically aim at enemies.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to follow to implement an aimbot in Fortnite using C++20:

Use a memory scanning library such as Boost.Interprocess or libsigscan to scan the game's memory for specific values or patterns that correspond to enemy locations and player coordinates.

Use a memory injection library such as Cheat Engine or Winject to inject your aimbot code into the game's memory.

Write your aimbot code in C++20 to automatically calculate the aim angle and apply it to the player's coordinates in the game.

Use the memory scanning and injection techniques to continuously read the game's memory, calculate the aim angle, and modify the player's coordinates to aim at enemies.

Note that writing an aimbot for Fortnite or any other game is a complex and time-consuming task, and it is generally not recommended due to the potential consequences of using such a tool. It is also important to be aware of the legal implications of reverse engineering and modifying a game's memory. You should only attempt to write an aimbot if you have a deep understanding of game mechanics and programming, and if you are willing to take on the associated risks.
